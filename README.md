# 🤖 Agentic AI – OpenAI Agent SDK Learning Journey  

This repository is dedicated to my **hands-on learning and exploration of the OpenAI Agent SDK**, as part of my journey into **Agentic AI development**.  
Here, I will document every concept, code experiment, and project I build while mastering the SDK.

## 📚 About OpenAI Agent SDK  
The **OpenAI Agent SDK** makes it easy to build **goal-driven AI agents** that can reason, plan, and act with minimal boilerplate.  
Instead of wiring up chains and prompts manually, you can:  
- Define an **Agent** with clear instructions (its role/behavior).  
- Use a **Model** (like GPT or Gemini via OpenAI-compatible API).  
- Run it with **Runner** to handle conversations, reasoning, and outputs automatically.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here  
This repo will include:  
- ✅ Basics of setting up **Agent & Runner**  
- ✅ Using **Gemini (via OpenAI-compatible API)** with the SDK  
- ✅ Experimenting with **structured outputs**  
- ✅ Building **role-based motivational, teaching, and helper agents**  
- ✅ Exploring **stateful conversations** with memory  
- ✅ Testing **real-world agent use cases** step by step
