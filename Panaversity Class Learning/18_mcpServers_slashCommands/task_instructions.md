# Task Instructions

This document outlines the steps to perform the image generation task using Daraz, LinkedIn, and Google AI Studio.

## Steps:

1.  **Open three browser tabs:**
    *   `https://www.daraz.pk`
    *   `https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat` (Directly open the new chat playground)
    *   `https://www.linkedin.com/login`

2.  **On Daraz (`https://www.daraz.pk`):**
    *   Search for "mens cargo shirts".
    *   Select the first suitable product (e.g., "Men;s long sleeves navy blue shirt with under white T Shirt").
    *   Open the product page.
    *   Download the main product image (e.g., `daraz_product_image.png`).

3.  **On Google AI Studio (`https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat`):**
    *   Ensure the model selected is "Nano Banana Pro". (If not, open "Run settings" and select it).
    *   Upload the `daraz_product_image.png` to the prompt box.
    *   Upload the `linkedin_profile_picture.png` to the prompt box.
    *   Enter the following prompt:
        "Combine these two images. Make me wear the selected cloth realistically. Maintain natural lighting, proper body alignment, and realistic proportions. Show how I will look wearing this cloth."
    *   Run the prompt to generate the image.

4.  **On LinkedIn (`https://www.linkedin.com/login`):**
    *   Log in if needed.
    *   Navigate to your profile page.
    *   Download your profile picture (e.g., `linkedin_profile_picture.png`).

## Note:

*   The file paths for downloaded images should be adjusted if not in the default download location.
*   Ensure that Google AI Studio is logged in and accessible.
*   The "Run" button in Google AI Studio might be disabled due to browser environment issues. If so, manual intervention or debugging of the browser environment might be required.
